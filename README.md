# fortran_python_sci_modules

in my last work i found out that python was lazyer than i think! and it killed me to calculate what I wanted from it. even when i wrote my programs in parallel on cuda! 
So I thought it would be better to change this situation. i thought that i must write something faster for pc qubit ssimulators. and this ripo is for it. for create some fast fortrani modules for python and doing some qubit simulations with them.
this might fail or i might fail but this is the begining and i hope that if even i cant complete it some others do it or help to me in this way.
anyway i will try to complete most of part over the time and transforme algorithems to cudafortran or maybe cudac or even python-cuda-etc to have a rich comparison between them.

## 000.* tensor product
i wrote the first function! a func for calculate tensorproduct between two matrixs and tested it fo |0>|0> and etc.
it was simple and necessariest for qubit simulating goal!
